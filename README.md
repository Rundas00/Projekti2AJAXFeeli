## About The App
Finnkino movie schedule app is a simple app that uses AJAX call to a live REST API in order to fetch Finnkino's movie information to my web app. It has search function and filter for the movie theater Helsinki: Tenniospalatsi for example. It shows the name of the movies, the show times and a picture. There is also a slot for description, but I was running out of time so I didn't figure out how to make it viable so currently it just shows "No description available". 

## Screenshots
Add here atleast one screenshot of the working application

## Technologies
Describe which technologies were used and the role of each in your project. 
I used the following technologies html, css, js. Html was for the base for the site and only includes stuff like title "Movie information app", option value to select the movie theater and the search bar. Css is for styling the site and creating the display boxes for movies etc. and also is responsible for colors and fonts. Js is responsible for the most important part for this which is fetching the data from the API, handling user input, rendering the movie images and handling showtimes. 

## Setup
Write brief instructions on how to run and use your app. For example:
- download all the files and open index.html in your browser or just use the netlify link. 
- choose theater
- scroll down the movies or use the search function for specific movie. 

## Status
Finnkino movies schedule app is still in complete.
