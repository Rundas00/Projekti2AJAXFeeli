## About The App
Finnkino movie schedule app is a simple app that uses AJAX call to a live REST API in order to fetch Finnkino's movie information to my web app. It has search function and filter for the movie theater Helsinki: Tenniospalatsi for example. It shows the name of the movies, the show times and a picture. There is also a slot for description, but I was running out of time so I didn't figure out how to make it viable so currently it just shows "No description available".
